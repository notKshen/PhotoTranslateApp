A Phototranslate Application to allow users to select pictures from the photo library or take pictures using the camera to help aid in learning new vocabulary.
This app implements photo storage using SwiftData, ensuring optimized performance and integration within iOS applications. Utilized CoreML to integrate machine learning 
models for image recognition of photos, enabling the recognition of the most dominant object in frame. Leveraged Google Cloud API for translating text 
from image recognition results, enabling translation to selected language.
